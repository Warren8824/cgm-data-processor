    "# CGM Data Quality Analysis Tutorial\n",
    "## Using cgm-data-processor with XDrip+ Backups\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a practical workflow for processing Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data using the cgm-data-processor tool. We'll walk through loading data from an XDrip+ SQLite backup, performing quality assessments, and exporting the processed data in a standardized format suitable for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The cgm-data-processor tool simplifies the process of working with CGM data by handling common preprocessing tasks and standardizing the output format. This example focuses on three key aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Loading: Extracting CGM measurements, carbohydrate records, and insulin data from an XDrip+ SQLite backup\n",
    "2. Quality Assessment: Evaluating data completeness, identifying gaps, and assessing measurement reliability\n",
    "3. Standardized Export: Saving the processed data in a consistent CSV format that facilitates further analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, ensure you have:\n",
    "- The cgm-data-processor package installed\n",
    "- An XDrip+ SQLite backup file\n",
    "- Basic familiarity with Python and pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The processed dataset will include:\n",
    "- Glucose measurements aligned to 5-minute intervals\n",
    "- Values in both mg/dL and mmol/L units\n",
    "- Validated carbohydrate and insulin records\n",
    "- Quality metrics for each time period\n",
    "- Clearly marked data gaps and interpolated values\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Quality Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this tutorial, we'll examine several key quality metrics:\n",
    "- Measurement frequency and consistency\n",
    "- Gap duration and distribution\n",
    "- Sensor reliability indicators\n",
    "- Record completeness for insulin and carbohydrate data\n",
    "\n",
    "This quality assessment helps ensure that subsequent analyses are based on reliable data and that any limitations are well understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this tutorial, you'll have a standardized dataset ready for various analyses such as:\n",
    "- Glucose variability assessment\n",
    "- Meal response patterns\n",
    "- Insulin sensitivity calculations\n",
    "- Time-in-range analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by importing the necessary libraries and setting up our environment."

    "1. Glucose Measurements (`bg_df`): This dataset contains continuous glucose monitoring readings, typically recorded at 5-minute intervals. Each reading includes the glucose value and associated metadata such as the timestamp and reading quality indicators.\n",

    "\n",
    "Both dataframes are automatically configured with their timestamps as indices, and dropping any rows with duplicate timestamps, facilitating temporal analysis and alignment in subsequent processing steps. The `XDrip` class handles the SQL queries and initial data structuring, ensuring consistent data types and timestamp handling across the extracted datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: These raw dataframes will undergo further processing and quality assessment before being combined into our standardized format. This two-stage loading approach allows us to validate and clean each data type independently before integration."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two optional parameters than can be supplied to this function:\n",
    "- bolus_limit - Number of units where insulin doses above this should be classified as basal, default = 8\n",
    "- max_limit - Number of units where user would suggest it must be an error to be discarded, default = 15\n",
    "\n",
    "The function handles several key aspects of insulin data processing:\n",
    "- Extracts insulin-specific records from the treatment dataset\n",
    "- Classifies insulin entries into basal and bolus categories - through meta-data or doseage\n",
    "- Validates dosage values and units\n",
    "- Standardizes timestamp formats\n",
    "- Removes any duplicate or invalid entries\n",
    "- Sets index to timestamp column\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The function filters for meaningful carbohydrate entries by keeping only records with 1.0 grams or more, eliminating negligible or potentially erroneous entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It handles duplicate timestamps by keeping only the first entry for any given time, which prevents double-counting of meals while preserving the earliest recorded entry.\n",

    "## Glucose Data Processing and Standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "The `clean_glucose()` function performs comprehensive processing of raw CGM data to create a standardized, analysis-ready glucose dataset with consistent time intervals and validated measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temporal Standardization\n",
    "The function first standardizes the temporal aspects of the data by rounding timestamps to 5-minute intervals, which is the standard measurement frequency for most CGM systems. It then creates a complete timeline by generating a continuous 5-minute interval index spanning the entire monitoring period. This ensures we have a consistent temporal structure, even when raw data points are missing or irregularly spaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gap Handling and Data Quality\n",
    "A key feature of the processing is its sophisticated handling of data gaps. The function identifies and flags missing data points, creating a 'missing' indicator that allows downstream analyses to distinguish between measured and interpolated values. For gaps up to 20 minutes (four 5-minute intervals), the function applies linear interpolation to estimate glucose values. This approach balances the need for continuous data with the importance of maintaining data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measurement Standardization\n",
    "The function implements several measurement quality controls:\n",
    "- Glucose values are constrained to a physiologically reasonable range of 39.64 to 360.36 mg/dL (2.2 to 20.0 mmol/L)\n",
    "- Measurements are provided in both mg/dL and mmol/L units using the standard conversion factor of 0.0555\n",
    "- Where multiple readings exist for a single 5-minute interval, they are averaged to provide a single representative value\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting dataset includes three essential columns:\n",
    "1. Glucose measurements in mg/dL\n",
    "2. Parallel measurements in mmol/L\n",
    "3. Missing data flags to indicate interpolated values\n",
    "\n",
    "This processed glucose dataset forms the backbone of our standardized CGM data structure, providing a reliable foundation for subsequent analysis while maintaining transparency about data quality and completeness."
